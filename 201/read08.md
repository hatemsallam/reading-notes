# Layout

## Building Blocks
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.
Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can
control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the
boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use
borders, margins, padding, and background colors.


## Containing Elements
If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.
It is common to group a number of elements together inside a div tag
(or other block-level) element. For example, you might group together
all of the elements that form the header of a site (such as the logo and
the main navigation). The div tag element that contains this group of
elements is then referred to as the containing element.


## Normal flow
Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.
Even if you specify the width
of the boxes and there is space
for two elements to sit side-byside,
they will not appear next
to each other. This is the default
behavior (unless you tell the
browser to do something else).


## Relative Positioning
This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed. This
does not affect the position of
surrounding elements; they stay
in the position they would be in
in normal flow.


## Absolute positioning
This positions the element
in relation to its containing
element. It is taken out of
normal flow, meaning that it
does not affect the position
of any surrounding elements
(as they simply ignore the
space it would have taken up).
Absolutely positioned elements
move as users scroll up and
down the page.


## Fixed Positioning
This is a form of absolute
positioning that positions
the element in relation to the
browser window, as opposed
to the containing element.
Elements with fixed positioning
do not affect the position of
surrounding elements and they
do not move when the user
scrolls up or down the page.


## Floating Elements
Floating an element allows
you to take that element out
of normal flow and position
it to the far left or right of a
containing box. The floated
element becomes a block-level
element around which other
content can flow.



## Overlapping Elements

When you use relative, fixed, or
absolute positioning, boxes can
overlap. If boxes do overlap, the
elements that appear later in the
HTML code sit on top of those
that are earlier in the page.
If you want to control which
element sits on top, you can use
the z-index property. Its value
is a number, and the higher the
number the closer that element
is to the front. For example, an
element with a z-index of 10
will appear over the top of one
with a z-index of 5.


## Creating Multi-Column Layouts with Floats

Many web pages use multiple
columns in their design. This
is achieved by using a div
element to represent each
column. The following three CSS
properties are used to position
the columns next to each other:
- width
This sets the width of the
columns.
- float
This positions the columns next
to each other.
- margin
This creates a gap between the
columns.
A two-column layout like the one
shown on this page would need
two div elements, one for the
main content of the page and
one for the sidebar.
Inside each of the div
elements there can be headings,
paragraphs, images, and even
other div elements.


## Layout Grids

Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography)
is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are
organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them
position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.

## CSS framework

CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for
common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating
printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS
framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.


## Summary
- div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
