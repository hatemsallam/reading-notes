## How People Access the Web

- Browsers
People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.
In order to view a web page,
users might type a web address
into their browser, follow a
link from another site, or use a
bookmark.
Software manufacturers
regularly release new versions
of browsers with new features
and supporting new additions
to languages. It is important,
however, to remember that
many computer owners will not
be running the latest versions
of these browsers. Therefore
you cannot rely on all visitors to
your site being able to use the
latest functionality offered in all
browsers.


- Web Servers
When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website.
Web servers are special
computers that are constantly
connected to the Internet, and
are optimized to send web pages
out to people who request them.
Some big companies run their
own web servers, but it is more
common to use the services of
a web hosting company who
charge a fee to host your site.


- Screen readers
Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.
In the same way that many
countries have legislations
that require public buildings
to be accessible to those with
disabilities, many laws have
also been passed that require
websites be accessible to those
with disabilities.


- Devices
People are accessing websites
on an increasing range of devices
including desktop computers,
laptops, tablets, and mobile
phones. It is important to
remember that various devices
have different screen sizes and
some have faster connections to
the web than others.


# HTML
## HTML Structure
HTML uses elements to describe the Structure of Pages
Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.
Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.


## Extra markups
Block level elements : elements that always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as .

Examples of block elements are

*<h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.*

Inline elements : elements that always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. .

Examples of inline elements are

*<a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.*
