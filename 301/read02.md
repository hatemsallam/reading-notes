# What are component lifecycle events?
React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events. These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states.

# Mounting
When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount all occur in this order during mounting.

# componentDidMount()
This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, donâ€™t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

# render()
Render is the only required method in a class component. It will examine this.props and this.state when called. The render function should not modify the component state because it would cause a lot of bugs by changing the state every time it rerenders. I also should not directly interact with the browser. render will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false. Here is an example of using render.


# Updating
Anytime a component is updated or state changes then it is rerendered. These lifecycle events happen during updating in this order.


# Unmounting
The final phase of the lifecycle if called when a component is being removed from the DOM. componentWillUnmount is the only lifecycle event during this phase.



# shouldComponentUpdate()
The default behavior in react is to rerender after every state change. Setting shouldComponentUpdate() to false allows you to prevent this from happening. This is in order to optimize performance. If you want to use this method, it may be better to use PureComponent instead, which performs a shallow comparison of props and state. If you do decide to use this method, be sure to check the previous props and state with the current props and state. If shouldComponentUpdate() returns false, then UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(), render(), and componentDidUpdate() will not be invoked.



# What Are Props? 
Props (aka "properties") in React allows us to pass values from a parent component down to a child component. The values can be any data type, from strings to functions, objects, etc.


# What is the big difference between props and state?

Basically, the difference is that state is something like attributes in OOP : it's something local to a class (component), used to better describe it. Props are like parameters - they are passed to a component from the caller of a component (the parent) : as if you called a function with certain parameters.

# When do we re-render our application?
 React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props. A simple update of the state, from anywhere in the code, causes all the User Interface (UI) elements to be re-rendered automatically. However, there may be cases where the render() method depends on some other data.


 # What are some examples of things that we could store in state?

   strings to functions, objects, etc.
