# what is Git?
Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

## Here is some examples of how you can use Git:
- when you want to import a file from github to your machine you will use (git clone URL) write get clone then write the url you want to import.
- use (git add .) to make the changes you made ready to push on github.
- use (git commit -m "Reasons of changes") to explain why you did the changes on the github file.
- use (git push origin main) to push your changes to github.
- you can use (git status) to know what to do if you face a problem.
