# Monetization

* To maximize your revenue, consider a flexible monetization strategy that adapts to your audiences and markets.
* Different audiences can have different preferences for paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions, ads, and other ecommerce.
* When you're developing a mobile application for Android and distributing it on Google Play, there are two primary ways you can accept payments:
    1. Google Play's billing system
    2. Google Pay.

## Sell digital goods or services with Google Play's billing system

* Once users save a payment method on Google Play, they can use that same payment method for all future purchases on Google Play with just a tap.
* Items that require developers to use Google Play's billing system include the following:
  * Virtual game products
  * App functionality or content
  * Subscription services
  * Cloud software products

## Sell physical goods or services with Google Pay

Products where we recommend developers use Google Pay include the following:

* Retail merchandise
* Physical services,
* One-time membership fees or recurring dues
* Electronic bill payment

## Other app monetization options

* Advertising: Get paid for showing Google AdMob ads, including native ads that allow you to match ads to your app's look and feel.
* Paid apps: Set a price for your app that the user must pay before they can download and install it. You can also take advantage of automatic local pricing (or set prices yourself), promo codes, and pricing templates.

## Best practices for setting your initial monetization strategy
