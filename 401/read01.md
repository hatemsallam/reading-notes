## Variables
You've already learned that objects store their state in fields. However, the Java programming language also uses the term "variable" as well. This section discusses this relationship, plus variable naming rules and conventions, basic data types (primitive types, character strings, and arrays), default values, and literals.
## Operators
This section describes the operators of the Java programming language. It presents the most commonly-used operators first, and the less commonly-used operators last. Each discussion includes code samples that you can compile and run.
## Expressions, Statements, and Blocks
Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values; expressions are the core components of statements; statements may be grouped into blocks. This section discusses expressions, statements, and blocks using example code that you've already seen.
## Control Flow Statements
This section describes the control flow statements supported by the Java programming language. It covers the decisions-making, looping, and branching statements that enable your programs to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.



# Making Sense of Java’s API Documentation

By Barry Burd

Once upon a time, people judged programming languages (including Java) solely by their grammatical features. Does an if statement do what you expect it to do? Are looping statements easy to use? Are methods implemented efficiently?

Nowadays, things are a bit different. Java has a whole collection of grammatical features, but Java is much more than just a big set of grammar rules. Java has a standard Application Programming Interface —a huge library consisting of over 4,000 classes, each with its own functionality, its own limitations, and its own rules for effective use.

Searching for a term
You can find things in the API documentation in a number of different ways. Each way is convenient in one situation or another. For example, Java has a method named System.out.println. What follows describes two ways to look up the System.out.println method.
