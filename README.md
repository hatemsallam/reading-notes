## Growth Mindset
Growth mindset is when people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.
 
 **There is some reminders of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset:**
- Accept opportunities that push you out of your comfort zone and remember challenges are chances to grow.
- You don't know what you don't know, so don't be afraid to ask questions.
- Appreciate obstacles.
- Mistakes are an important part of the process.
